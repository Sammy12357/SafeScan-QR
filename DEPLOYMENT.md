# SafeScan QR Deployment Notes

## Persistent leaderboard and scan data

SafeScan stores users, sessions, scan counts, scan history, leaderboard rows, referrals, wallets, and admin records in SQLite by default.

For production on Render, mount a persistent disk at:

```text
/var/data
```

Use these environment variables:

```text
DATA_DIR=/var/data
SQLITE_DB_PATH=/var/data/qr_cache.db
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////var/data/qr_cache.db
```

Do not store production data in `/app/data` unless a Render persistent disk is explicitly mounted there. The `/app` directory is rebuilt during deploys, so SQLite data there can disappear after a push or service restart.

If an older deployment already has a database at `/app/data/qr_cache.db`, copy it to `/var/data/qr_cache.db` before changing the environment variables.
